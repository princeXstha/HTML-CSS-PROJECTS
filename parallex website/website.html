                The altitude of the Himalayan region ranges between 4,877 m. to 8,848 m. It includes eight of the highest 14 summits in the world, which exceed an altitude of 8,000 meters including the world highest mountain Sagarmatha (Mount Everest).
The mountain region accounts for about 64% of total land area, which is formed by the Mahabharat range that soars up from 4,877 m. and the lower Churia range. The lowland Terai occupies about 17% of the total land area of the country.

                Due to Nepal’s extreme geography, its biomes range from tropical to arctic with everything in between. This wild and biodiverse country has humid lowlands where one-horned rhinos and leopards meander and high cliffs where snow leopards and blue sheep leap from sheer face to sheer face. While on treks in Nepal it’s possible to see stunning animals found nowhere else in the world, such as red pandas and Himalayan butterflies. In the country’s national parks you can see rare river dolphins, bizarre looking crocodiles, and take jungle safaris to scout out tigers and leopards. Explore with us in this blog post some of Nepal’s most fantastic wildlife!
